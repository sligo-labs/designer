 *    `selectDesignTab` changes which tab that is. A navigation issued for
 *    project B therefore moves the tab project A is mid-flight on, so scoping by
 *    project let exactly the interleaving this exists to prevent through.
 *
 * Parallel `--key` work is genuinely serialized by this, and that is correct
 * rather than a regression: with one active tab per session those operations
 * were never safe concurrently, they merely failed silently instead of loudly.
 *
 * Re-entrant per OPERATION via AsyncLocalStorage, not per instance: deleteFile
 * legitimately calls fetchFile -> openFile, which must not deadlock, while two
 * genuinely concurrent calls — even on the same controller — still exclude each
 * other because they run in different async contexts.

   * Delete ONE named file from this key's project, or preview what would be

   * present in both the plain-HTML and .dc.html canvas views.
   *
   * The product has no undo, so every step is written to fail CLOSED:
   *
   *  - ROOT-PIN. `_ensureInSession` returns early on ANY /design/p/ tab, so it
   *    is not a pin. The project root is re-asserted before the confirm click
   *    and on every settle poll ('wrong-project' / 'project-changed').
   *  - REFUSE ON AMBIGUITY. Switcher rows carry no extension, so
   *    "Canvas.dc.html" and "Canvas.html" render the same label. Two matches =>
   *    'ambiguous' before anything is hovered — never a guess.
   *  - VERIFY-AND-STAMP. The confirm dialog is the only surface naming the full
   *    filename. One page expression parses its quoted name, compares with
   *    `===`, and stamps the button to click, so the node that was verified is
   *    the node that gets clicked (no verify-here / click-there gap).
   *  - TRUSTED INPUT. Hover + clicks go through the facade (real CDP input);
   *    synthetic element.click() silently no-ops on some of these menus.
   * Full reasoning, and the alternatives that were refuted live:
   * docs/adr/0001-destructive-ui-automation-safety.md
   *
   *  - POSITIVE SETTLE. Rows exist only while the popover is open, so "no rows"
   *    is NOT proof of deletion. Success requires the row set to shrink by
   *    exactly one; empty/unreadable reads are inconclusive and cap out as
   *    'outcome-unknown' rather than a false ok.

  //     (no claude.ai cookies) returns the same ~1.1KB unauthenticated loader
  //     shell for EVERY file — never the rendered HTML. The rendered DOM lives

  //     parent page JS can't read. So read it over CDP via OopifHtmlReader

  // the on-disk source file. For the byte-stability / no_change / snapshot uses
